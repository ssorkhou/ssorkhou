- Hi, I’m @ssorkhou, a PhD student studying mathematics at the University of Toronto.
- I am interested in data science and machine learning. Detecting patterns and being able to find stories in raw data is fascinating! I am balancing my time between my PhD studies and learning all I can about data science and machine learning. I am working on some projects to hone my skills as well as for personal interest and I intend to post these projects here!
- Check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saied-sorkhou) for more about me.
