- Hi, I’m @ssorkhou
- I’m interested in data science and machine learning. Detecting patterns and being able to find stories in raw data is fascinating!
- I’m currently finishing off my PhD in mathematics at the University of Toronto. At the same time, I am teaching myself all I can learn about data science in the hopes of pursuing a career in this field. I am working on some projects to hone my skills as well as for personal interest and I intend to post these projects here!
- I'm definitely looking to connect if you're interested! Check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saied-sorkhou-717265205) and [personal webpage](https://www.math.toronto.edu/sorkhous/) for more about me.
